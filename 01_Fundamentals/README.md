# Deep Learning Fundamentals

## What is machine learning?

According to **Arthur Samuel** machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
  
In machine learning we rather than wirting set of instruction to accomplish a particular task we train the machine.
  
For example, let's say we want to make a system that will check if a particular message is positive or negative. To accomplish this in **traditional programming** we will make an algorithm and give a list of positive and negative words and then check occurence of them in the message and then decide if the message is positive or negative. Whereas, in **machine learning** we provide a set of data to the a machine learning algorithm and let it learn to classify the message as positive or negative.
